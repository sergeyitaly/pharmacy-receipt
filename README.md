This project, which collects and visualizes pharmacy sales data, can provide significant value in disease analysis and customer sales insights. Here’s how you can benefit from it:

1️⃣ Identify Trends in Medication Sales
By analyzing top-selling products over time (like your Top 10 chart), you can detect:
Seasonal patterns (e.g., cold medicines peak in winter).
Sudden spikes in certain drug sales, which may indicate outbreaks or increased prevalence of specific conditions.
Metrics such as quantity sold, revenue, and occurrences give a detailed picture of demand.

2️⃣ Correlate Sales with Disease Patterns
Sales data can serve as a proxy for disease prevalence:
High sales of antipyretics, cough syrups, or antivirals could hint at flu outbreaks.
Tracking repeated purchases of chronic medication can reveal patterns in chronic disease management.
Combining sales with location and timestamps can allow geospatial and temporal disease tracking.

3️⃣ Optimize Stock and Reduce Waste
Understanding which products sell most and least helps pharmacies:
Reduce overstock of rarely sold items.
Ensure critical medicines are always available.
By forecasting demand trends based on historical data, you can predict seasonal spikes in diseases and adjust inventory proactively.

4️⃣ Improve Customer Insights & Personalization
Your platform tracks customer-level sales data (even anonymously via barcodes or repeated purchases):
Identify frequent customers and their preferences.
Recommend products for preventive care or chronic disease management.
Example: Customers frequently buying antihypertensives may benefit from alerts about complementary products (like low-sodium diets or vitamins).

5️⃣ Enable Regulatory & Health Reporting
Aggregated sales data can be shared with health authorities for monitoring drug usage.
Identify potential self-medication trends that may require public health intervention.

6️⃣ AI & Predictive Analysis
With your export CSV functionality, you can feed the data into AI models for:
Predicting disease outbreaks.
Forecasting sales trends.
Recommending personalized promotions to customers.

7️⃣ Visual Insights
Charts and tables (with sorting, filtering, themes) allow:
Quick identification of top products and revenue drivers.
Detect anomalies or sudden spikes in sales.
Shareable dashboards for management or health agencies.
